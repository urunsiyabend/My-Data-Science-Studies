# **Introduction**

This github repository contains my data science notes that are taken while I was working with the [(50 Saat) Python A-Zâ„¢: Veri Bilimi ve Machine Learning
](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-egitimi/) course. I hope these notes will help you when you want to review your knowledge about data science.

For now, these studies includes 3 different parts of data science and a section about aplications that I hope you will be able to understand how data science is used in business. This repository will be updated day by day and I will try to keep this descriptions updated but if you realize missing parts on this file please feel free to create pull requests. And please excuse my typos as I am currently working to improve my language skills.
